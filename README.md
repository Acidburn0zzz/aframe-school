# aframe-workshop

Official [A-Frame](https://aframe.io) interactive tutorial.

Can either be self-led or be used as part of a hands-on event (e.g., tutorial
or workshop). If you are holding an event, also check out the [A-Frame
Presentation Kit](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-presentation-kit) to
present beforehand.

## Grabbing the Workshop

If you're having trouble accessing the Workshop online and need to download the
Workshop locally (e.g., the Internet connection at your event is poor):

1. [Download the Workshop
(.ZIP)](http://github.com/aframevr/aframe-workshop/zipball/master)
2. Start a local web server in the same directory as the Workshop (e.g., run
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer` in a terminal). Alternatively, run `mongoose.exe`
on Windows and `mongoose.app` on MacOS.

## Working on the Workshop

The Workshop is built using [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/).
All of the pages of the Workshop are maintained in a single markdown file,
`content.md`. Use `------` to separate sections and `---` to separate
subsections.
